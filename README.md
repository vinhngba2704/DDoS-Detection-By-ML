In this project, I will try a new approach to prevent DDoS attack.

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is one of the common type of network
attack which exhausts the resource of Victim (can be a machine, a computer
, a server)

This approach is using knowledge from data science field, including machine
learning and deep learning technique for detecting malicious traffic. Then 
making approriate actions with them.
